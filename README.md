# Listr
A listing app written in Swift for iOS.

**Listr** is an app I developed following Mark Price's iOS 10 course.
The idea is to list all the items/things you wish to buy, adding the item's _picture, price, details_ and the _store_ you wish to buy it from.
It uses **Core Data** to save user input, and sorts the entries based on _date created, title_ or _price_.
